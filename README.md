# WP-project-1
This project is designed to showcase CSS transitions, transforms, and animations. 
Our group was tasked with coming up with a concept that could be used to show all three.
We decided to go with an interactive recipe page to implement the concepts.
Animation is used to animate the text for the group members. 
Transform was used in a few locations to help with positioning of items, as well as to add an animation to the button present at the top of the page.
Transition was also utilized within the button, as well as to animate the various images within the ingredients portion of the page.
The recipe itself is from the food network, and has been linked within the page as well.
